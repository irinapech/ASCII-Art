# ASCII Art

This project aims to develop an ASCII Art Console App that takes a picture as input and converts it into an ASCII art representation. The app generates a visual output by printing ASCII characters to the terminal, imitating the input image. The ASCII Art Console App is designed for a wide range of users who are interested in creating visually appealing and artistic representations of their images using ASCII characters. It caters to individuals with various backgrounds, including artists, designers, hobbyists, and enthusiasts, who appreciate ASCII art's aesthetic appeal and uniqueness. The app allows users to input an image of their choice from their local storage. It then processes the image and converts it into ASCII art using a predefined set of ASCII characters.
